Hello Team,

I initially created the project as per instruction using Frontend Technology like React JS, HTML, CSS, JavaScript. I have used Route functionality alongside ith some input functionality from the user 

At first, I have started used App.js File to create route to different paths. I have not used any protected route paths because, I am not setting up any authentication or authorization in this project, as per required information I have build a layout.

Additionally I have added features like Make an appointment form from user input in home page and linking them to about page, as well as make an appointment page displays the appointment details once we click on it after entering the details.

I have also designed a search input bar and location to select accordingly provided with dummy datas.

The challenges I faced was connecting the layout as per the figma file given, in select your mode of session I have used scroll bar to access further as I was unable to align with same spacing on A little about me tab.

I tried to change the user interface of select your mode of session to make user friendly additionally to get inputs.

I have just used select statement with no functions for expertise, gender, fees, languages and all filters, since not sure about options and created it as per layout

Also when you click on headers, it would link to following pages and you can see the change in their route path and I have linked multiple buttons to respond accordingly to the details from the given 2 components.

I would also like to inform that I am aware of backend technology, I can eventually create a data using Mongodb and Postman API or fetch details from given URL. Since my project is based on Frontend I have completely focused on that.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
